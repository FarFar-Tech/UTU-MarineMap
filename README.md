# Overview

UTU MarineMap is designed to enhance maritime situational awareness for a wide range of stakeholders, including coastguards, local authorities, port authorities, and shipping companies. By leveraging advanced AI-driven services—such as ship movement prediction, abnormal behavior detection, and sea-ice classification from satellite images—UTU MarineMap offers unique, practical insights that help streamline decision-making and improve safety. This combination of real-time analytics and predictive modeling distinguishes it from other maritime tracking solutions, ultimately providing greater clarity and efficiency for users across the sector.

# Design

Our UI design process begins with in-depth user research—combining interviews and surveys with a diverse group of stakeholders to uncover their unique needs and expectations. Using Figma as our primary design tool, we rapidly prototype and iterate on layouts, ensuring the interface remains intuitive and streamlined for all users. We deliberately selected simple color palettes and UI components to keep navigation clear and accessible, recognizing that maritime professionals must quickly and accurately parse critical data. While our current design is already functional, it is still a work in progress, and we remain committed to ongoing refinement as new insights and requirements emerge.
